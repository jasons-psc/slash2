- pull and compile slash2 before starting (wrapper scipt)
- add more intense tests
- finish web UI
- collect resource usage (of tests and slash2)
  * getrusage() doesn't implement memory statistics on linux. We can use gdbcmd files and signals to handle this on linux, but we need a newer version of gdb
  * test_hander needs to recieve the hosts and of each slash2 resource, so it can query for resource statistics

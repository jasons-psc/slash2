Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Running
-------

  1) Run MongoDB
  2) Launch tsuite:

     $ python ./run.py -c $config_file

Modifying the deployment configuration
--------------------------------------

  Edit tsuite configuration: conf/tsuite.conf
  Edit corresponding slcfg:  res/tsuite.conf

Runtesting an existing tree (for testing patches)
-----------------------------------------------

Set `srcroot' to the location of a tree with binaries in the expected
location and `svnroot' to null and launch tsuite:

  [source]
  srcroot = /home/joeuser/sl2.ts/projects
  [svn]
  svnroot = ""

Runtesting old repo revisions
------------------------------

Set `srcroot' to a location for the checkout and workdir and set
`svnroot' and `srcrev' parameters and launch tsuite:

  [source]
  srcroot = /home/joeuser/sl2.ts/projects
  [svn]
  svnroot = ""

Runtesting HEAD
------------------------------

The ideal setup would be a nightly crontab for historical performance
reference.  This could probably be arranged with the following setup
similiar to the usage above:

  [source]
  srcroot = /home/joeuser/sl2.ts/projects
  [svn]
  svnroot = svn+ssh://frodo/cluster/svn/projects
  srcrev = HEAD

Killing all tsuite running services
------------------------------------

In case execution fails, some services may still be running for debug purposes. 
These can be killed with:

  $ python run.py --only kill:all

Modifying the testing behavior units
------------------------------------

  It would be nice if tests could be language agnostic in `slash2_tests'
  subdir.  A batch of standard testing programs would be tremendously
  useful:

    - IOZone
    - POSIX compliancy
    - slash2 self-build
    - Linux kernel build
    - assortment of fio tests

Analyzing results
-----------------

  $ python tsuite_browser/run.py
  $ firefox localhost:$port

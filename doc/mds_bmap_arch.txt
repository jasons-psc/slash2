MDS Data Structure Overview
---------------------------

RPCs which may be needed:
     CLI_2_MDS:
	REASSIGN IOS - there will be issues here when other clients 
		       don't agree that the ios needs to be failed.

     MDS_2_ION:
	IO PING - try to verify that an ION is working.
     

pscrpc_export -> mexpfc 
	      . from here we can tell if the export is of type:
	      	MDS_EXP_ION or MDS_EXP_CLI
	      . if we're dealing with MDS_EXP_CLI, then 
	        struct mexpfc_cli is invoked.

		
mexpfch
	. pointed to by export
	. uses a flag to determine the handle type (cli or ion).
	. tie in point which maintains the bindings for client io's to 
	a specific ion.  All client reads and writes go to this ion.

	** Failover methods will be important here.. and will determine
	what sort of write caching will be allowable.

	For instance, if a client reports that an ION has failed, the mds
	must take action to reassign the bmdsi_ion - otherwise 
	crc updates may become non-deterministic.  This means that a valid
	write operation will entail:
	      - originate from the client (cache or dio)
	      - sent to ION
	      - written to ION storage
	      - CRCs committed to MDS

	.. this method will guarantee that once a failover / ion 
	reassignment has occured, that we can ignore crc updates from 
	the reassigned / replaced ion.

	ION_PING() 
		   if this ping fails.. what happens?

mexpfc_cli
	. maintains a list of fids
	  - where the export type == MDS_EXP_CLI, this lists
	  all the fids which that client has cached (bmaps or inode attrs).

	  - is this relevant for IONs?
	    . filesize? - don't think so
	    . therefore the exp_fidtree and friends are moved into their
	    own structure (mexpfc_cli)


MDS Bmap Dereferencing
----------------------
MDS Bmaps get dereferenced once they've LRU'd out of the client's cache or when 
the clients close the file.

Client must track the read and write modes of his bmaps so that deref's on the 
mds can occur properly.
    1) This is tracked in bmapi_mode on both the client and mds.
    2) For a client which access a bmap for write and read then he will send a 
    deref val of '2' or two separate derefs.
    3) In the event of a client disconnect, all of his bmaps must be deref'd
       which means that the mds must keep a reference, per client for both 
       read and write.


MDS / CLI / ION - Bmap Read and Write Policies
----------------------------------------------
A) Read-only Mode Bmaps

Readers of different replica bmaps should be directed to an ION based on their 
preference or proximity of the replica.  Any cache mode may be used by any / all
clients.  All of this assumes that no writers are present.

B) Write-only Mode Bmaps

   b0. When only a single client is issuing writes, that client may use any 
       caching policy available to him.
  
   b1. Upon addition of a second bmap writer, the first writer is instructed
       to flush his cache and issue subsequent writes in direct-io mode 
       - bmap_2_dio(). The new writer(s) must also issue all writes with 
       direct-io.  

       Using direct-io provides the most straight forward means of ensuring
       write ordering and cache coherency.

C) Read / Write Bmaps

   c0. When on the same client, a bmap in read/write mode may proceed, as
       expected, using any cache policy desired so long as the same policy
       is applied to all operations (on that bmap).  
       	  * Policy is stored in bcm_mode (BMAP_CLI_DIO).

   c1. On different clients
       c1a. Write -> Read/Write
       	    The existing writer is instructed to call bmap_2_dio() to
	    flush his cache and set his bmap to synchronous mode **.

	    Once this act has been acknowledged by the MDS, he issues the 
	    bmap to the reader client with bmapi_mode set to BMAP_CLI_DIO.

	    ** It's not determined what will happen if this client 
	    does not respond in a timely fashion.  As of now, the ION
	    is not involved in this process.
	   
       c1b. Write -> Read/Write (multiple writers)
       	    The current writers are already set to dio mode so no further
	    action is necessary other than to return the client's bmap
	    with BMAP_CLI_DIO set.

       c2a. Read -> Read/Write (single and multiple readers)
       	    All readers are asked to flush their caches and proceed with 
	    BMAP_CLI_DIO.  The writer's bmap is returned with 
	    BMAP_CLI_DIO as well.
       	    
D) Issues
   d1.  Client-drived access to replicas is made difficult by this method.
   	If the client knows where to retrieve a replica he should be able to 
	do so without being stunted by the mds.

	. Could the client retreive in dio mode?  Yes, but presumably the 
	client is accessing a secondary or tertiary replica which means that 
	latency is more likey to be an issue.
	    
	Answer:  This is not a problem because as long as the bmap is in 
	BMAP_CLI_RD mode no other clients are writing to it which means that 
	the client is free to read from any replica (in caching mode) that 
	he wishes.  However, some logic will be needed client-side to override
	the mds recommended ion (bmapi_ion).

   d2.  Client disconnects must be deref'd properly.
 
E) Devel needed
   e1. Method for flushing and closing a bmap's offtree cache on the client.
   e2. Method for client-side direct io.

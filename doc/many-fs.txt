Right now, we support only one file system in the pool. In the furture:

 * More than one file system per pool is allowed.

 * The contents of all file systems are accessible from a slash2 client.

 * Only one file system can be made writable per mds, all other file systems 
   are strictly read-only.

The idea is that the pool layout will be the same across MDS.  Only one MDS
can write a file system, and we will use snapshot mechanism to propagate
the updates to other MDs.

The root file system is a place holder now, not really used by any MDS.  We
need to fake the contents of the root to allow access to other file systems.
Presumably, we can put private stuff to the root file system that will not
be shared by other MDS in any way.

We will use site id bits in the fid for each file systems.  The ID of the 
root file system is 0.   

There could be compatibility issue.  Right under root, we can have existing
files and directories that do not represent a file system.

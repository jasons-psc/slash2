This document describes the network stack initialization and slash.slcfg
automatic profile self discovery.

The following actions are taken depending on the value of the 'nets'
slash.slcfg option:

  (o) if 'nets' is a single Lustre network name, such as "tcp10",
      network interface/Lustre network name pairs are constructed from
      each interface address registered in the system and this specified
      Lustre network name.  The resulting list of pairs is copied into
      the daemon process environment as LNET_NETWORKS.

  (o) if 'nets' is a fully fledged LNET_IP2NETS value, this value is
      used to determine which addresses held by SLASH2 peers correspond
      to which Lustre networks and the system's network interfaces are
      queried to determine routes to such peers.

These behaviors will be overridden if LNET_NETWORKS is already specified
in the process environment, which always takes precedence.

Otherwise, LNET_NETWORKS is fabricated based on the values specified in
the SLASH2 configuration.

LNET_NETWORKS is then parsed to determine routable addresses and their
corresponding Lustre network names.  These pairs are used to assign
Lustre networks to the resource node addresses listed in the slash.slcfg
site resources configuration.

I want to start as simple as possible.  As we gain experience, we can be more sophisticated
as need be.  

(1) Write each unlink operation into the system log before replying the unlink RPC.

(2) Distill the log entry from the tile and write into the one of the unlink log files.

    Each unlink entry consists of the following information:
 
	* The identity of the file: slash ID and generation number
	* The identities of the I/O servers that have a copy of the file at the moment.

(3) Read the unlink log files and send RPCs to I/O servers.  An unlink log file will be removed when
    all relevant I/O servers have responded.

SLASH2 has been outfitted with zfs-fuse-0.6.9 (from 0.6.0) yesterday.  After light testing, no serious problems were discovered in the 100,000 line patch in most standard paths of SLASH.

A lot was introduced in zfs-fuse as the forerunner to the next major version release (0.7.0, due soon), such <tt>/zfs-kstat</tt>, a fuse-mounted file system <em>brought up by the MDS</em> (or more specifically, the ZFS listener daemon), which reports stats about backend file system activity.  Their <a href="http://zfs-fuse.net/releases/0.6.9">release page</a> lists other critical bugs and features addressed in the newer release.

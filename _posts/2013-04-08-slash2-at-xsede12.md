J Ray Scott gave a talk about SLASH2 and its application in <a href="http://www.psc.edu/index.php/users/storage-resources">PSC's new storage archiver system</a>.  The talk covered the architecture of the system, from hardware all the way up to the application level, as well as the historical timeline and other logistics of operation since the system has gone into production.

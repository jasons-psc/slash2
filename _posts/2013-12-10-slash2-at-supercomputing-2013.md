SLASH2 was featured in the PSC booth at SC13 in Denver, CO.  The demo included a graphical interface for passersby to actually drive a SLASH2 deployment file system and manage replicas and watch data coherency in realtime, all the way remotely back to Pittsburgh!

Handouts covering high level system internals as well as handouts for the <a href="https://www.psc.edu/index.php/users/storage-resources">Data SuperCell</a> and <a href="https://www.psc.edu/index.php/newscenter/2013/872-psc-lands-76-million-data-exacell-grant">Data ExaCell</a> were also being distributed.  The material seemed to be well received by many!

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has approved a grant to Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) to develop a prototype Data Exacell (DXC), a next-generation system for storing, handling and analyzing vast amounts of data.  The $7.6-million, four-year grant will allow PSC to architect, build, test and refine DXC in collaboration with selected scientific research projects that face unique challenges in working with and analyzing “Big Data.”

The full press release is available here:

SLASH2 will be just one of the software interfaces available to access the capabilities of the new storage resource.  The system will focus on much higher performance demands than previous deployments featuring SLASH2, so it will be excited to see how fast we can go and how far we can scale out!
